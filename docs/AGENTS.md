- **Design thinking** - Consider maintainability and extensibility
- **Professional habits** - Daily practices that improve code quality

### **Assessment Philosophy**
- **Competency-based** - Focus on demonstrable skills
- **Self-directed** - Enable independent learning verification
- **Progressive** - Track skill development over time
- **Practical** - Assess real coding abilities

---

## 🚫 **What NOT to Include**

### **Avoid These Content Types**
- **Purely academic theory** without practical application
- **Toy examples** that don't reflect real development
- **Language-specific minutiae** unless educationally relevant
- **Outdated practices** that aren't used in modern development
- **Religious debates** about coding styles (focus on principles)

### **Content That Belongs Elsewhere**
- **Personal opinions** on tools or frameworks
- **Company-specific policies** or practices
- **Incomplete or draft content** (use drafts/ directory)
- **Internal planning documents** (covered by .gitignore)

---

## 🛠️ **Technical Guidelines**

### **File Naming Conventions**
- **Principle directories**: `01-meaningful-names/`, `02-functions/`, etc.
- **Exercise files**: `exercise-1-descriptive-name.md`
- **Example files**: `before-example-name.java`, `after-example-name.java`
- **Supporting files**: `checklist.md`, `README.md`, `solutions.md`

### **Markdown Standards**
- **Headers**: Use proper hierarchy (H1 for main title, H2 for sections)
- **Code blocks**: Always specify language for syntax highlighting
- **Links**: Use relative paths for internal links
- **Images**: Store in `assets/` subdirectories, use descriptive names
- **Tables**: Use for comparisons and structured data

### **Code Standards**
- **Language consistency** - Use idiomatic patterns for each language
- **Commenting** - Focus on why, not what
- **Error handling** - Include realistic error scenarios
- **Testing** - Include test examples where relevant
- **Modern practices** - Use current language features and patterns

---

## 📝 **Common Tasks & Guidelines**

### **Adding New Exercises**
1. **Follow existing patterns** - Look at completed exercises for structure

3. **Provide multiple problems** - 3-5 scenarios per exercise
4. **Create solution files** - Always include solutions directory
5. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure examples compile and run

### **Enhancing Examples**
1. **Start with before/after** - Show clear transformation
2. **Explain the problems** - Why is the "before" code problematic?
3. **Detail the improvements** - What makes the "after" code better?
4. **Provide context** - What business scenario does this represent?
5. **Include variations** - Show different approaches when applicable

### **Creating Checklists**
1. **Daily applicability** - Items developers can use every day
2. **Specific and actionable** - Clear yes/no criteria
3. **Principle-focused** - Aligned with specific clean code principle
4. **Progressive difficulty** - From basic to advanced checks
