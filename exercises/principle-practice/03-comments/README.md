## 📝 Exercise Instructions

### How to Complete Exercises

1. **Analyze the starting code** - Identify comment problems and opportunities
2. **Apply self-documenting techniques** - Make code clearer through structure and naming
3. **Evaluate remaining comments** - Keep only those that add genuine value
4. **Refactor systematically** - Work through code section by section
5. **Test for clarity** - Can someone understand the code without explanatory comments?
6. **Document your reasoning** - Note why you kept or removed specific comments

### Evaluation Criteria

For each exercise, evaluate your solutions against these criteria:

**Code Clarity (30%)**:
- Can the code be understood without explanatory comments?
- Do function and variable names reveal their intent?
- Is the code structure logical and easy to follow?

**Comment Value (25%)**:
- Do remaining comments explain "why" rather than "what"?
- Are comments necessary for understanding business rules or constraints?
- Do comments warn about important consequences or limitations?

**Maintainability (25%)**:
- Are comments likely to stay current as code evolves?
- Is comment information available elsewhere (tests, documentation)?
- Are comments closely tied to the relevant code?

**Readability (20%)**:
- Is the overall signal-to-noise ratio improved?
- Are important comments easy to find among the code?
- Does the code tell a clear story without distraction?

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Before You Start
- **Set up a clean workspace** - Have your code editor and testing environment ready
- **Review the principles** - Keep the comments checklist handy for reference
- **Plan your approach** - Think about how to systematically improve code clarity
- **Prepare for iteration** - Plan to make multiple passes through the code

### During the Exercises
- **Question every comment** - Ask "Does this add information not obvious from code?"
- **Try self-documenting first** - Always attempt to improve code before adding comments
- **Focus on the "why"** - If keeping a comment, ensure it explains reasoning or consequences
- **Think about maintenance** - Will this comment stay current as code evolves?

### After Each Exercise
- **Compare your approach** - See how your solutions differ from provided examples
- **Identify patterns** - What self-documenting techniques worked best?
- **Plan application** - How will you apply these techniques in your daily work?
- **Share insights** - Discuss your learnings with teammates or mentors

## 🔧 Self-Documenting Techniques Toolbox

### **Extract Method**
Replace comment blocks with well-named functions:
```javascript
// Before: Comment explains what code does
// Validate that user has permission to access resource
if (user.role === 'admin' || user.id === resource.ownerId) {
    // Process the request
}

// After: Function name explains what code does
if (userCanAccessResource(user, resource)) {
    processRequest();
}
```

### **Intention-Revealing Names**
Use variable names that eliminate need for comments:
```python
# Before: Comment explains variable purpose
data = fetch_user_data(user_id)  # Contains user profile and preferences

# After: Variable name reveals purpose
user_profile_and_preferences = fetch_user_data(user_id)
```

### **Explanatory Variables**
Break complex expressions into named parts:
```java
// Before: Comment explains complex condition
if (order.total > 100 && user.membershipLevel.equals("premium") && order.itemCount > 5) {
    // Apply bulk discount for premium members
}

// After: Explanatory variables eliminate need for comment
boolean qualifiesForBulkDiscount = order.total > 100 && 
                                  user.membershipLevel.equals("premium") && 
                                  order.itemCount > 5;
if (qualifiesForBulkDiscount) {
    applyBulkDiscount(order);
}
```

### **Guard Clauses**
Make code flow clearer through early returns:
```python
# Before: Nested conditions with comments
def process_payment(payment_data):
    if payment_data is not None:
        if payment_data.amount > 0:
            if payment_data.card_token is not None:
                # Process the actual payment
                return gateway.charge(payment_data)
            else:
                # Handle missing card token
                raise ValueError("Card token required")
        else:
            # Handle invalid amount
            raise ValueError("Amount must be positive")
    else:
        # Handle missing payment data
        raise ValueError("Payment data required")

# After: Guard clauses make flow clear
def process_payment(payment_data):
    if payment_data is None:
        raise ValueError("Payment data required")
    
    if payment_data.amount <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Amount must be positive")
    
    if payment_data.card_token is None:
        raise ValueError("Card token required")
    
    return gateway.charge(payment_data)
```
