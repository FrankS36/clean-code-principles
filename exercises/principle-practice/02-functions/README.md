## üèãÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Completed [Meaningful Names exercises](../01-meaningful-names/README.md)
- Understanding of basic programming concepts
- Read the [Functions Principle](../../../principles/02-functions/README.md)
- Familiarity with [Side Effects concepts](../../../resources/concepts/side-effects.md)

### Recommended Approach
1. **Start with extraction** - Learn to break down large functions first
2. **Work systematically** - Complete exercises in order for best learning progression
3. **Practice actively** - Don't just read, actually refactor the code
4. **Test your solutions** - Write simple tests to verify your refactored functions work
5. **Reflect on improvements** - Consider how your changes improve readability and testability

### Exercise Format
Each exercise follows this structure:
- **Problem Description** - The function design issues to solve
- **Starting Code** - Poorly designed functions to refactor
- **Requirements** - Specific goals for the refactoring
- **Step-by-Step Guidance** - Hints for approaching the problem
- **Success Criteria** - How to evaluate your solution
- **Advanced Challenges** - Additional improvements for experienced developers

## üìù Exercise Instructions

### How to Complete Exercises

1. **Analyze the starting code** - Identify function design problems
2. **Plan your refactoring** - Decide how to break down responsibilities
3. **Extract functions incrementally** - Don't try to solve everything at once
4. **Name functions clearly** - Apply meaningful naming to each extracted function
5. **Test as you go** - Verify each extracted function works correctly
6. **Review and refine** - Look for further improvement opportunities

### Evaluation Criteria

For each exercise, evaluate your solutions against these criteria:

**Single Responsibility (25%)**:
- Does each function do only one thing?
- Can you explain each function's purpose in one sentence?

**Size and Readability (25%)**:
- Are functions small enough to understand at a glance?
- Is the code self-documenting through good function names?

**Parameter Design (20%)**:
- Do functions have minimal, well-designed parameters?
- Are dependencies explicit rather than hidden?

**Testability (20%)**:
- Can each function be tested in isolation?
- Are pure functions separated from side effects?

**Maintainability (10%)**:
- Is the code easy to modify and extend?
- Are concerns properly separated?

## üéì Learning Progression

### Beginner Path
If you're new to function design:
1. Start with **Exercise 1 (Extraction)** - Learn the fundamental skill
2. Move to **Exercise 2 (Parameters)** - Practice parameter design
3. Try **Exercise 3 (Side Effects)** - Understand pure vs impure functions
4. Challenge yourself with **Exercise 5 (Refactoring)** - Apply to realistic code

### Intermediate Path
If you have some experience with clean functions:
1. Jump to **Exercise 3 (Side Effects)** - Master purity and separation
2. Tackle **Exercise 4 (Composition)** - Learn advanced function patterns
3. Complete **Exercise 5 (Refactoring)** - Work with complex scenarios
4. Return to **Exercise 2 (Parameters)** - Perfect your parameter design

### Advanced Path
Looking for maximum challenge:
- Complete all exercises in multiple programming languages
- Create your own exercises based on functions in your current projects
- Mentor others using these exercises as teaching tools
- Contribute improvements and additional exercises to the project

## üí° Tips for Success

### Before You Start
- **Set up your environment** - Have a way to run and test code
- **Create a workspace** - Separate directory for your exercise solutions
- **Plan your time** - Block out focused time for each exercise
- **Review principles** - Keep the functions checklist handy for reference

### During the Exercises
- **Start small** - Extract one function at a time
- **Test frequently** - Verify each change works before moving on
- **Think about names** - Spend time choosing clear, descriptive function names
- **Consider the caller** - How will other code use these functions?

### After Each Exercise
- **Compare solutions** - See how your approach differs from provided examples
- **Identify patterns** - What function design strategies worked well?
- **Apply learnings** - How can you use these techniques in your real work?
- **Share progress** - Discuss your solutions with others for feedback

## üîß Tools and Resources
