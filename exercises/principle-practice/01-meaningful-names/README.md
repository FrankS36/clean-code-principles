## üèãÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Familiarity with at least one programming language
- Read the [Meaningful Names Principle](../../../principles/01-meaningful-names/README.md)

### Recommended Approach
1. **Start with your comfort zone** - Pick exercises in your preferred language
2. **Work incrementally** - Complete one exercise before moving to the next
3. **Don't peek at solutions** - Try to solve each problem independently first
4. **Reflect on choices** - After each exercise, think about why you chose specific names
5. **Compare with solutions** - Use the provided solutions to learn alternative approaches

### Exercise Format
Each exercise follows this structure:
- **Problem Description** - What you need to accomplish
- **Starting Code** - Poorly named code to improve
- **Requirements** - Specific goals and constraints
- **Hints** - Guidance when you get stuck
- **Success Criteria** - How to know you've succeeded
- **Bonus Challenges** - Additional improvements for advanced learners

## üìù Exercise Instructions

### How to Complete Exercises

1. **Read the problem thoroughly** - Understand what you're trying to accomplish
2. **Analyze the starting code** - Identify what makes the current names problematic
3. **Apply naming principles** - Use the guidelines from the main principle
4. **Test your improvements** - Ensure your renamed code is more readable
5. **Document your reasoning** - Keep notes on why you chose specific names
6. **Review and refine** - Iterate on your names to make them even clearer

### Evaluation Criteria

For each exercise, evaluate your solutions against these criteria:

**Clarity (25%)**:
- Can someone unfamiliar with the code understand what each element does?
- Do names reveal intent without requiring comments?

**Consistency (25%)**:
- Do similar operations use similar naming patterns?
- Are naming conventions applied consistently throughout?

**Searchability (20%)**:
- Can elements be easily found when searching the codebase?
- Are names specific enough to be unique in search results?

**Appropriateness (20%)**:
- Do names use the right vocabulary for the context (business vs. technical)?
- Are names the right length - not too short, not unnecessarily long?

**Maintainability (10%)**:
- Will these names still make sense as the code evolves?
- Do names help or hinder future modifications?

## üéì Learning Progression

### Beginner Path
If you're new to clean naming practices:
1. Start with **Exercise 1 (Variables)** - Foundation skills
2. Move to **Exercise 2 (Functions)** - Apply to behavior
3. Try **Exercise 4 (API Design)** - See patterns in action
4. Challenge yourself with **Exercise 5 (Legacy Refactoring)**

### Intermediate Path
If you have some experience with clean code:
1. Jump to **Exercise 3 (Classes)** - Object-oriented design
2. Tackle **Exercise 5 (Legacy Refactoring)** - Real-world scenarios
3. Complete **Exercise 2 (Functions)** - Perfect your technique
4. Finish with **Exercise 4 (API Design)** - System-level thinking

### Advanced Challenges
Looking for extra difficulty:
- Complete all exercises in multiple programming languages
- Create your own exercises based on your current projects
- Review open source projects and suggest naming improvements
- Teach the principles to others using these exercises

## üí° Tips for Success

### Before You Start
- **Set up your environment** - Have your preferred code editor ready
- **Block out time** - These exercises work best with focused attention
- **Prepare to iterate** - Plan to revise your names multiple times
- **Keep a notebook** - Document insights and patterns you discover

### During the Exercises
- **Think aloud** - Verbalize your reasoning for name choices
- **Consider multiple options** - Don't settle on the first name that comes to mind
- **Test readability** - Read your renamed code aloud to check flow
- **Ask "why" questions** - Why does this element exist? What is its purpose?

### After Each Exercise
- **Compare with solutions** - See how your approach differs from the provided answers
- **Identify patterns** - What naming strategies worked well?
- **Plan application** - How will you apply these learnings to your real work?
- **Share and discuss** - Get feedback from others on your naming choices

## üîß Tools and Resources

### Helpful Tools
- **Code formatter** - Maintain consistent style while focusing on names
- **Search functionality** - Test how searchable your names are
- **Spell checker** - Ensure professional, error-free names
- **Thesaurus** - Find alternative words when stuck

### Reference Materials
- [Meaningful Names Principle](../../../principles/01-meaningful-names/README.md)
- [Naming Examples](../../../examples/before-after/naming-examples/README.md)
- [Quick Reference Checklist](../../../principles/01-meaningful-names/checklist.md)
- Language-specific style guides for your preferred programming language

```

### Skill Assessment
After completing all exercises, rate yourself (1-5 scale):

- [ ] **Variable Naming**: I can consistently choose clear, meaningful variable names
- [ ] **Function Naming**: My function names clearly indicate purpose and behavior
- [ ] **Class Design**: I can name classes that clearly represent their responsibilities
- [ ] **API Consistency**: I can design consistent, intuitive interfaces
- [ ] **Legacy Improvement**: I can improve existing code's naming systematically

**Target**: All scores should be 4 or 5 before moving to the next principle.

## üöÄ Ready to Start?

Choose your starting point:
- **[Exercise 1: Variables](./exercise-1-variables.md)** - Perfect for beginners
- **[Exercise 3: Classes](./exercise-3-classes.md)** - Great for OOP experience
- **[Exercise 5: Legacy Refactoring](./exercise-5-legacy-refactoring.md)** - For real-world challenge

Remember: The goal isn't to get everything perfect immediately, but to develop the habit of thinking carefully about names and continuously improving them.
