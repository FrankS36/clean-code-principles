## Problem 1: E-commerce Shopping Cart

### Current Code (JavaScript)
```javascript
// ‚ùå Poor variable names
let u = getCurrentUser();
let c = getCart(u.id);
let t = 0;
let s = 0.08; // sales tax rate
let d = 50; // free shipping threshold

for (let i of c.items) {
    t += i.p * i.q;
}

let tax = t * s;
let total = t + tax;
let fs = t >= d;

if (fs) {
    displayMessage("Free shipping!");
} else {
    let needed = d - t;
    displayMessage(`Add $${needed} for free shipping`);
}
```

### Your Task
Rename all variables to be clear and meaningful. Focus on:
- What each variable represents
- Eliminating abbreviations
- Making the code self-documenting

### Requirements
- [ ] All single-letter variables should be renamed (except loop counter if appropriate)
- [ ] Abbreviations should be spelled out
- [ ] Variable purposes should be clear without comments
- [ ] Names should be searchable and pronounceable

### Hints
- Think about the business domain (e-commerce)
- Consider what each calculation represents
- Use full words instead of abbreviations
- Make boolean variables clearly yes/no questions

    usr = db.find_user(un)
    if not usr:
        return {'success': False, 'err': 'User not found'}
    
    hashed = hash_password(pw)
    if usr['pw_hash'] != hashed:
        usr['failed_attempts'] += 1
        if usr['failed_attempts'] >= 3:
            usr['locked'] = True
            db.save(usr)
        return {'success': False, 'err': 'Invalid password'}
    
    usr['last_login'] = datetime.now()
    usr['failed_attempts'] = 0
    token = generate_token(usr['id'])

        return amt / n
    
    numerator = amt * m * (1 + m) ** n
    denominator = (1 + m) ** n - 1
    payment = numerator / denominator
    
    total = payment * n
    interest = total - amt
    
    return {
        'payment': payment,
        'total': total,

- The code reads almost like natural language
- Comments are rarely needed to explain variable purposes

### Searchability Test
- Variables can be easily found when searching the codebase
- Names are specific enough to return relevant results
- No conflicts with common programming terms

### Consistency Test
- Similar concepts use similar naming patterns
- Domain terminology is used consistently
- Naming conventions are applied uniformly

### Maintainability Test
- Variable purposes remain clear as code evolves
- New team members can quickly understand the code
- Refactoring is easier because intent is clear

## üí° Hints and Strategies

### General Approach
1. **Identify the domain** - What business or technical domain does this code serve?
2. **List the concepts** - What real-world things do these variables represent?
3. **Use domain language** - Prefer business terms over technical jargon when appropriate
4. **Be specific** - `userAccount` is better than `account` if the context allows
5. **Test pronunciation** - Can you easily say the name in conversation?

### Common Patterns
- **Counts**: `itemCount`, `userCount`, not just `count`
- **Flags**: `isValid`, `hasPermission`, `canAccess`
- **Collections**: `activeUsers`, `pendingOrders`, `completedTasks`
- **Calculations**: `totalPrice`, `monthlyPayment`, `taxAmount`
- **Thresholds**: `minimumAge`, `maximumRetries`, `freeShippingThreshold`

### Domain-Specific Tips

**E-commerce**: Use terms like `cart`, `checkout`, `shipping`, `discount`
**Authentication**: Use terms like `credentials`, `token`, `session`, `permissions`
**Financial**: Use terms like `principal`, `interest`, `payment`, `balance`
**Gaming**: Use terms like `player`, `turn`, `score`, `level`

## üéØ Self-Assessment

After completing each problem, rate your solution (1-5 scale):

- **Clarity**: How clear are the variable names?
- **Consistency**: How consistent is the naming pattern?
- **Searchability**: How easy would it be to find these variables?
- **Domain Appropriateness**: How well do names fit the business domain?

**Target**: All scores should be 4 or 5. If any score is 3 or below, revise your solution.

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

Once you've completed all problems:

1. **Review the [solutions file](./exercise-1-solutions.md)** to compare approaches
2. **Apply learnings to your current code** - Find similar naming issues in your projects
3. **Move to [Exercise 2: Functions](./exercise-2-functions.md)** to practice function naming
4. **Create your own examples** - Find poorly named variables in open source projects

Remember: Great variable names are the foundation of clean, maintainable code. Take your time and choose names that will make sense to your future self and your teammates!
