### Starting Code (Return Codes Pattern)
```python
class FileProcessor:
    SUCCESS = 0
    FILE_NOT_FOUND = -1
    PERMISSION_DENIED = -2
    INVALID_FORMAT = -3
    PROCESSING_ERROR = -4
    
    def process_file(self, file_path: str) -> tuple[int, str]:
        # Check if file exists
        if not os.path.exists(file_path):
            return self.FILE_NOT_FOUND, ""
        
        # Check permissions
        if not os.access(file_path, os.R_OK):
            return self.PERMISSION_DENIED, ""
        
        # Read file
        try:
            with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
                content = f.read()
        except Exception:
            return self.PROCESSING_ERROR, ""
        
        # Validate format
        if not self.is_valid_format(content):
            return self.INVALID_FORMAT, ""
        
        # Process content
        try:
            result = self.process_content(content)
            return self.SUCCESS, result
        except Exception:
            return self.PROCESSING_ERROR, ""
