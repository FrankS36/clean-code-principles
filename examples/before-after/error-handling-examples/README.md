# Error Handling - Before/After Examples

This directory contains practical examples showing the transformation from poor error handling patterns to clean, robust error management. These examples demonstrate proper exception usage, meaningful error messages, and resilient system design.

## üìÅ Examples Overview

### 1. **return-codes-bad.java** ‚Üí **exceptions-good.java**
**Transformation**: Return Codes ‚Üí Clean Exception Handling
- **Before**: Error codes mixed with business logic, cluttered control flow
- **After**: Clean separation of happy path and error handling using exceptions
- **Key Principles**: Use Exceptions Rather Than Return Codes, Provide Context

### 2. **silent-failures-bad.py** ‚Üí **proper-error-handling-good.py**
**Transformation**: Silent Failures ‚Üí Robust Error Management
- **Before**: Errors swallowed silently, system failures go unnoticed
- **After**: Comprehensive error handling with logging, monitoring, and recovery
- **Key Principles**: Fail Fast, Error Context Preservation, Structured Logging

### 3. **error-patterns-comparison.ts**
**Demonstration**: Multiple Error Handling Patterns
- Shows various approaches: Result types, Maybe/Optional, Exception hierarchies
- Demonstrates when to use each pattern
- Illustrates error aggregation and graceful degradation

## üéØ Learning Objectives

After studying these examples, you should be able to:

1. **Replace return codes** with proper exception handling
2. **Create meaningful exception hierarchies** that match caller needs
3. **Provide rich error context** for debugging and monitoring
4. **Implement robust error recovery** strategies
5. **Design fail-fast systems** that detect problems early
6. **Use structured logging** for error tracking and analysis

## üìö How to Study These Examples

### Step 1: Analyze the "Bad" Examples
- Identify how errors are handled (or not handled)
- Notice how error checking clutters the business logic
- See what information is lost when errors occur
- Observe how failures can cascade or go unnoticed

### Step 2: Study the Transformation
- Compare the before and after code structure
- Notice how exceptions clean up the happy path
- See how error context is preserved and enhanced
- Observe how different error types are handled appropriately

### Step 3: Apply the Patterns
- Look for similar error handling patterns in your code
- Practice converting return codes to exceptions
- Implement proper error logging and monitoring
- Design error recovery strategies for your systems

## üé® Key Patterns Demonstrated

### **Exception Hierarchies**
Organizing exceptions based on how they should be handled, not just what caused them.

### **Resource Management**
Proper cleanup of resources even when exceptions occur, using try-finally or resource management patterns.

### **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
Preventing cascading failures by temporarily stopping calls to failing services.

### **Retry with Exponential Backoff**
Handling transient failures gracefully with intelligent retry logic.

### **Error Aggregation**
Collecting multiple errors before reporting them, especially useful for validation scenarios.

### **Graceful Degradation**
Providing reduced functionality when full functionality isn't available.

## üîç What to Look For

When studying these examples, pay attention to:

- **Before**: How do return codes clutter the business logic?
- **After**: How do exceptions clean up the happy path?
- **Before**: What happens when errors are ignored or swallowed?
- **After**: How is error context preserved and used for debugging?
- **Before**: How do generic error messages frustrate users and developers?
- **After**: How do specific, contextual error messages help resolve issues?

## üöÄ Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### **Silent Failures**
Catching exceptions without logging or handling them appropriately.

### **Generic Exception Handling**
Using overly broad catch blocks that treat all errors the same way.

### **Error Code Soup**
Mixing error checking with business logic, making code hard to read and maintain.

### **Null as Error**
Returning null to indicate errors instead of using exceptions or Result types.

### **Exception for Control Flow**
Using exceptions for normal program flow instead of exceptional conditions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical Applications

### **API Error Responses**
Learn how to translate internal exceptions into meaningful HTTP responses with appropriate status codes and error messages.

### **Database Error Handling**
See how to handle different types of database errors (connection failures, constraint violations, timeouts) appropriately.

### **External Service Integration**
Understand how to handle errors from external services, including network failures, timeouts, and service unavailability.

### **Validation Error Management**
Learn to collect and present multiple validation errors in a user-friendly way.

## üß™ Testing Error Conditions

### **Exception Testing**
Examples of how to properly test exception scenarios and error handling paths.

### **Error Simulation**
Techniques for simulating different types of failures in tests to verify error handling behavior.

### **Recovery Testing**
Testing that systems properly recover from error conditions and continue functioning.

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Read the examples** in order, starting with return codes ‚Üí exceptions transformation
2. **Complete the exercises** in `/exercises/principle-practice/06-error-handling/`
3. **Apply these patterns** to your current projects
4. **Use the checklist** in `/principles/06-error-handling/checklist.md` for code reviews

Remember: The goal is not just to catch errors, but to build systems that fail gracefully, provide meaningful feedback, and recover automatically when possible.
