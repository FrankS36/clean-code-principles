# Meaningful Names: Before & After Examples

This directory contains real-world examples showing the transformation from poor naming to clean, meaningful naming. Each example demonstrates specific naming principles in action.

## ðŸ“š Example Categories

### 1. Variable Naming Examples
- **Context**: Everyday variable naming scenarios
- **Focus**: Intention-revealing names, avoiding abbreviations
- **Files**: `variables-bad.js`, `variables-good.js`

### 2. Function Naming Examples
- **Context**: Method and function naming
- **Focus**: Verb phrases, single responsibility indication
- **Files**: `functions-bad.py`, `functions-good.py`

### 3. Class and Interface Naming
- **Context**: Object-oriented design naming
- **Focus**: Noun phrases, clear responsibilities
- **Files**: `classes-bad.java`, `classes-good.java`

### 4. API Design Naming
- **Context**: Public interface design
- **Focus**: Consistency, searchability, clarity
- **Files**: `api-bad.ts`, `api-good.ts`

### 5. Domain-Specific Naming
- **Context**: Business domain concepts
- **Focus**: Domain language, avoiding technical jargon when business terms are clearer
- **Files**: `domain-bad.js`, `domain-good.js`

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Use These Examples

### Study Method
1. **Read the "bad" version first** - Try to identify the problems
2. **List what makes it problematic** - Practice recognizing naming issues
3. **Think of improvements** - How would you rename things?
4. **Compare with the "good" version** - See the clean code solution
5. **Read the explanation** - Understand the reasoning behind changes

### Practice Approach
- **Type out the examples** - Don't just read, actually code along
- **Modify and experiment** - Try your own variations
- **Apply to your code** - Look for similar patterns in your projects
- **Discuss with others** - Share and get feedback on naming choices

## ðŸ’¡ Key Learning Points

Each example demonstrates:
- **Specific naming principles** in action
- **Common mistakes** and how to avoid them
- **Context considerations** - when different approaches work better
- **Trade-offs** - balancing clarity with brevity
- **Consistency patterns** - maintaining naming conventions
