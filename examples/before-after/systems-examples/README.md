# Systems and Architecture Examples

This directory contains comprehensive before/after examples demonstrating clean architecture principles and system design patterns at scale.

## üèõÔ∏è **Architecture Transformations**

See how monolithic, tightly-coupled systems can be transformed into clean, maintainable architectures using the principles covered in [Principle 10: Systems and Architecture](../../../principles/10-systems/README.md).

## üìÅ **Examples Overview**

### **1. [Monolith to Clean Architecture](./monolith-to-clean-architecture/)**
**Scenario**: E-commerce system transformation
- **Before**: Monolithic architecture with mixed concerns
- **After**: Clean Architecture with proper layer separation
- **Principles**: Dependency Rule, Entity separation, Use Case isolation

### **2. [Legacy System Boundaries](./legacy-system-boundaries/)**
**Scenario**: Payment processing system integration
- **Before**: Tight coupling with legacy systems
- **After**: Clean boundaries and adapters
- **Principles**: Boundary isolation, Adapter pattern, Anti-corruption layers

### **3. [Microservices Communication](./microservices-communication/)**
**Scenario**: Order management across microservices
- **Before**: Direct service coupling and shared databases
- **After**: Event-driven architecture with proper boundaries
- **Principles**: Service independence, Event sourcing, Domain boundaries

### **4. [Domain-Driven Design](./domain-driven-design/)**
**Scenario**: Complex business domain modeling
- **Before**: Anemic domain model with procedural logic
- **After**: Rich domain model with proper aggregates
- **Principles**: Domain modeling, Aggregate design, Bounded contexts

## üéØ **Learning Progression**

1. **Start with Monolith to Clean Architecture** - foundational patterns
2. **Study Legacy System Boundaries** - real-world integration challenges
3. **Explore Microservices Communication** - distributed system patterns
4. **Master Domain-Driven Design** - advanced domain modeling

## üí° **Key Takeaways**

Each example demonstrates:
- **Before**: Common architectural problems and anti-patterns
- **After**: Clean architecture solutions with proper separation
- **Process**: Step-by-step transformation methodology
- **Benefits**: Measurable improvements in maintainability and testability

**Remember**: Clean architecture isn't about perfect design from day one‚Äîit's about evolving systems toward better structure while maintaining functionality and business value.
