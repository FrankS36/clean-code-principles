## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will:
- Understand why naming is the most fundamental clean code skill
- Be able to choose names that reveal intent and avoid confusion
- Recognize and fix common naming problems in your code
- Apply consistent naming conventions across your projects
- Write code that rarely needs explanatory comments

## üí° Why Meaningful Names Matter

**The Problem**: We spend far more time reading code than writing it. Poor names force readers to constantly translate between what the code says and what it means, creating mental overhead and opportunities for misunderstanding.

**The Solution**: Names that clearly communicate intent make code self-documenting, reducing cognitive load and making maintenance easier.

**The Impact**: 
- ‚úÖ Faster code comprehension
- ‚úÖ Fewer bugs from misunderstanding
- ‚úÖ Easier maintenance and refactoring
- ‚úÖ Better team collaboration
- ‚úÖ Reduced need for explanatory comments

## üìö Core Guidelines

### 1. Use Intention-Revealing Names

Names should clearly communicate what the variable represents, what the function does, or what the class is responsible for.

**‚ùå Bad:**
```javascript
let d; // elapsed time in days
let users; // actually active users only
function getData() { /* returns formatted user profile */ }
```

**‚úÖ Good:**
```javascript
let elapsedTimeInDays;
let activeUsers;
function getFormattedUserProfile() { /* returns formatted user profile */ }
```

**Key Questions to Ask:**
- Why does this exist?
- What does it do?
- How is it used?

If your name doesn't answer these questions, it needs improvement.

### 2. Avoid Disinformation

Don't use names that have established meanings in programming or that could mislead readers about the actual content or behavior.

**‚ùå Bad:**
```python
# 'list' suggests a Python list, but it's actually a set
user_list = {user1, user2, user3}  

# 'hp' could mean health points, horsepower, Hewlett-Packard
def calculate_hp(engine):
    return engine.displacement * engine.cylinders

# 'accounts' suggests multiple, but it's singular
def process_accounts(account):
    # processes a single account
```

**‚úÖ Good:**
```python
active_users = {user1, user2, user3}

def calculate_horsepower(engine):
    return engine.displacement * engine.cylinders

def process_account(account):
    # processes a single account
```

**Common Disinformation Patterns:**
- Using type names that don't match the actual type
- Using plural when dealing with singular (or vice versa)
- Using abbreviations that have multiple meanings
- Using names similar to existing variables but with different meanings

### 3. Make Meaningful Distinctions

When you need multiple similar variables or functions, the differences in their names should clearly indicate their different purposes.

**‚ùå Bad:**
```java
// What's the difference between these?
public void copyChars(char a1[], char a2[]) {
    for (int i = 0; i < a1.length; i++) {
        a2[i] = a1[i];
    }
}

// Noise words that don't add meaning
String nameString;  // redundant - name is obviously a string
Customer customerObject;  // redundant - customer is obviously an object
Money moneyAmount;  // redundant - money is obviously an amount
```

**‚úÖ Good:**
```java
public void copyChars(char source[], char destination[]) {
    for (int i = 0; i < source.length; i++) {
        destination[i] = source[i];
    }
}

// Clear, meaningful names
String customerName;
Customer customer;
Money accountBalance;
```

**Noise Words to Avoid:**
- `Data`, `Info`, `Object`, `Manager`, `Processor`
- Number series: `a1`, `a2`, `a3`
- Redundant type information in the name

### 4. Use Pronounceable Names

Code is read and discussed by humans. Pronounceable names make communication easier and more professional.

**‚ùå Bad:**
```typescript
class DtaRcrd102 {
    private genymdhms: Date;
    private modymdhms: Date;
    private pszqint = "102";
}
```

**‚úÖ Good:**
```typescript
class Customer {
    private generationTimestamp: Date;
    private modificationTimestamp: Date;
    private recordId = "102";
}
```

**Benefits of Pronounceable Names:**
- Easier to discuss in meetings and code reviews
- More professional appearance
- Better for documentation and teaching
- Easier to remember and mental model

### 5. Use Searchable Names

In any significant codebase, you'll need to search for names. Single-letter variables and magic numbers are nearly impossible to find.

**‚ùå Bad:**
```python
# Good luck searching for 'e' or '7'
for e in employees:
    if e.age > 7:
        e.status = 'eligible'

# Magic number - what does 86400 represent?
time_remaining = deadline - current_time
if time_remaining < 86400:
    send_urgent_notification()
```

**‚úÖ Good:**
```python
for employee in employees:
    if employee.years_of_service > MINIMUM_SERVICE_YEARS:
        employee.status = 'eligible'

SECONDS_PER_DAY = 86400
time_remaining = deadline - current_time
if time_remaining < SECONDS_PER_DAY:
    send_urgent_notification()
```

**Searchability Guidelines:**
- Avoid single-letter variables (except for very short loop counters)
- Use named constants instead of magic numbers
- Make names specific enough to be unique when searching
- Consider how names will appear in search results

### 6. Avoid Mental Mapping

Readers shouldn't have to translate your names into concepts they understand. Use problem domain names directly.

**‚ùå Bad:**
```javascript
// Reader has to remember: r = url, d = data, u = user
function processRequest(r, d, u) {
    // What does this function actually do?
    const result = transform(d);
    log(u, r, result);
    return result;
}
```

**‚úÖ Good:**
```javascript
function processUserDataRequest(url, userData, user) {
    const transformedData = transformUserData(userData);
    logUserAction(user, url, transformedData);
    return transformedData;
}
```

**When Mental Mapping is Acceptable:**
- Very short loops with conventional variables (`i`, `j`, `k`)
- Well-established conventions in the specific domain
- Mathematical formulas where single letters have established meanings

### 7. Class Names Should Be Nouns

Classes represent things, so they should be named with nouns or noun phrases. Avoid verbs in class names.

**‚ùå Bad:**
```java
class Process { }  // Too generic, also sounds like a verb
class Data { }     // Too generic
class Manager { }  // What does it manage?
class DoPayroll { } // This is a verb phrase
```

**‚úÖ Good:**
```java
class PayrollProcessor { }
class CustomerAccount { }
class EmailService { }
class UserProfile { }
```

### 8. Method Names Should Be Verbs

Methods do things, so they should be named with verbs or verb phrases that clearly describe what they do.

**‚ùå Bad:**
```python
def user():  # What about the user?
    pass

def email():  # Send? Receive? Validate?
    pass

def payment_status():  # Get? Set? Check?
    pass
```

**‚úÖ Good:**
```python
def authenticate_user():
    pass

def send_welcome_email():
    pass

def check_payment_status():
    pass
```

**Method Naming Patterns:**
- `get_*()` for retrieving data
- `set_*()` or `update_*()` for modifying data
- `is_*()` or `has_*()` for boolean checks
- `create_*()` or `build_*()` for construction
- `validate_*()` or `verify_*()` for checking validity

### 9. Pick One Word per Concept

Be consistent in your vocabulary. If you use `get` to retrieve data in one place, don't use `fetch` or `retrieve` for the same concept elsewhere.

**‚ùå Bad:**
```typescript
class UserService {
    getUser(id: string) { /* ... */ }
    fetchUserProfile(id: string) { /* ... */ }
    retrieveUserSettings(id: string) { /* ... */ }
}
```

**‚úÖ Good:**
```typescript
class UserService {
    getUser(id: string) { /* ... */ }
    getUserProfile(id: string) { /* ... */ }
    getUserSettings(id: string) { /* ... */ }
}
```

**Consistency Benefits:**
- Predictable naming patterns
- Easier to remember method names
- Clearer mental model of the codebase
- Reduced cognitive load

### 10. Use Solution Domain Names

When appropriate, use computer science terms, algorithm names, pattern names, and math terms. Your readers are programmers.

**‚úÖ Examples:**
```java
class VisitorPattern { }
class JobQueue { }
class BinarySearchTree { }
class HashTable { }
```

### 11. Use Problem Domain Names

When there's no programmer-friendly name, use names from the problem domain. Someone familiar with the business domain can explain them.

**‚úÖ Examples:**
```python
class MortgageCalculator { }
class PatientRecord { }
class InsuranceClaim { }
class InventoryItem { }
```

## üö® Common Naming Mistakes

### 1. Abbreviations and Acronyms
```javascript
// ‚ùå Bad
let usr = getCurrentUsr();
let addr = usr.getAddr();
let ph = usr.getPhoneNum();

// ‚úÖ Good
let user = getCurrentUser();
let address = user.getAddress();
let phoneNumber = user.getPhoneNumber();
```

### 2. Hungarian Notation
```csharp
// ‚ùå Bad (outdated Hungarian notation)
string strFirstName;
int iUserCount;
bool bIsValid;

// ‚úÖ Good
string firstName;
int userCount;
bool isValid;
```

### 3. Noise Words
```java
// ‚ùå Bad
UserData userData;
UserInfo userInfo;
UserObject userObject;

// ‚úÖ Good
User user;
UserProfile profile;
UserAccount account;
```

### 4. Context-Free Names
```python
# ‚ùå Bad - no context about what kind of name
def validate(name):
    pass

# ‚úÖ Good - clear context
def validate_username(username):
    pass

def validate_product_name(product_name):
    pass
```

## üéØ Naming Conventions by Language

### JavaScript/TypeScript
```javascript
// Variables and functions: camelCase
const userCount = 10;
function getUserProfile() { }

// Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
const MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 3;
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://api.example.com';

// Classes: PascalCase
class UserManager { }
class PaymentProcessor { }

// Private members: prefix with underscore (convention)
class User {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
        this._id = generateId(); // private by convention
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
# Variables and functions: snake_case
user_count = 10
def get_user_profile():
    pass

# Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 3
API_BASE_URL = 'https://api.example.com'

# Classes: PascalCase
class UserManager:
    pass

class PaymentProcessor:
    pass

# Private members: prefix with underscore
class User:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self._id = self._generate_id()  # private by convention
```

### Java
```java
// Variables and methods: camelCase
int userCount = 10;
public User getUserProfile() { }

// Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
public static final int MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 3;
public static final String API_BASE_URL = "https://api.example.com";

// Classes: PascalCase
public class UserManager { }
public class PaymentProcessor { }

// Private members: camelCase
public class User {
    private String name;
    private String id;
    
    public User(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.id = generateId();
    }
}
```

## üìù Quick Naming Checklist

Before finalizing any name, ask yourself:

- [ ] **Intent**: Does the name clearly reveal what this represents or does?
- [ ] **Searchable**: Can I easily find this name when searching the codebase?
- [ ] **Pronounceable**: Can I easily say this name in a conversation?
- [ ] **Unambiguous**: Is there only one reasonable interpretation of this name?
- [ ] **Consistent**: Does this name follow the same patterns as similar items?
- [ ] **Appropriate Length**: Is it long enough to be clear but short enough to be practical?
- [ ] **Context-Aware**: Does this name make sense in its context?
- [ ] **Domain-Appropriate**: Does this name use the right vocabulary (technical vs. business)?
