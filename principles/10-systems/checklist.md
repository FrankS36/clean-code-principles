# Systems and Architecture Checklist

A practical daily checklist for applying clean architecture principles in system design and development.

## 🏛️ **Daily Architecture Decisions**

Use this checklist when designing, reviewing, or refactoring systems to ensure clean architecture principles are followed.

---

## 📋 **System Structure Checklist**

### **🔄 Dependency Rule**
- [ ] **Dependencies point inward** - Outer layers depend on inner layers, never the reverse
- [ ] **No domain dependencies on infrastructure** - Business logic doesn't import database, web, or external service code
- [ ] **Use cases don't depend on controllers** - Application layer is independent of delivery mechanism
- [ ] **Entities are dependency-free** - Core business logic has no external dependencies

### **🎯 Layer Separation**
- [ ] **Clear layer boundaries** - Each layer has a distinct responsibility
- [ ] **Interface-based communication** - Layers communicate through abstractions, not concrete classes
- [ ] **No layer skipping** - Don't bypass layers (e.g., controller directly calling repository)
- [ ] **Proper abstraction levels** - Each layer operates at an appropriate level of abstraction

---

## 🏗️ **Domain Design Checklist**

### **📦 Entities and Value Objects**
- [ ] **Business rules in entities** - Core business logic is encapsulated in domain entities
- [ ] **Immutable value objects** - Value objects are immutable and have value equality
- [ ] **Factory methods for creation** - Complex object creation uses factory methods with validation
- [ ] **Domain invariants protected** - Objects cannot be created or modified in invalid states

### **🔍 Use Cases and Services**
- [ ] **Single responsibility per use case** - Each use case handles one specific business operation
- [ ] **Application services coordinate** - Use cases orchestrate without containing business rules
- [ ] **Domain services for complex logic** - Multi-entity business rules are in domain services
- [ ] **Clear boundaries between layers** - Application logic is separate from business logic

---

## 🔗 **Integration and Boundaries Checklist**

### **🚪 External System Integration**
- [ ] **Adapter pattern for external APIs** - External systems are accessed through adapters
- [ ] **Anti-corruption layers** - Protect domain from external system data models
- [ ] **Interface segregation** - Dependencies are on focused interfaces, not large contracts
- [ ] **Dependency inversion** - Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations

### **🗄️ Database and Persistence**
- [ ] **Repository pattern** - Data access is abstracted behind repository interfaces
- [ ] **Domain entities separate from data models** - Business objects are independent of database schema
- [ ] **Database in infrastructure layer** - Persistence details are in the outer layer
- [ ] **Transaction boundaries at use case level** - Transactions wrap complete business operations

---

## 🧪 **Testing and Quality Checklist**

### **✅ Testability**
- [ ] **Unit tests for business logic** - Domain entities and services are thoroughly tested
- [ ] **Integration tests for use cases** - Application workflows are tested with real collaborators
- [ ] **Acceptance tests for user scenarios** - End-to-end tests verify business value
- [ ] **Test doubles for external dependencies** - External systems are mocked in tests

### **🔧 Maintainability**
- [ ] **Changes are localized** - Modifications affect minimal number of classes
- [ ] **Business logic is centralized** - Related business rules are co-located
- [ ] **Technical concerns are separated** - Infrastructure code doesn't mix with business code
- [ ] **Clear dependency direction** - Dependency flow follows the dependency rule

---

## 📊 **Component Design Checklist**

### **🎯 Component Cohesion**
- [ ] **Release Equivalence Principle (REP)** - Components contain classes that change together
- [ ] **Common Closure Principle (CCP)** - Classes that change for the same reasons are in the same component
- [ ] **Common Reuse Principle (CRP)** - Classes that are used together are in the same component

### **🔗 Component Coupling**
- [ ] **Acyclic Dependencies Principle (ADP)** - No cycles in component dependency graph
- [ ] **Stable Dependencies Principle (SDP)** - Depend on components that are more stable
- [ ] **Stable Abstractions Principle (SAP)** - Stable components should be abstract

---

## 🏢 **Architectural Patterns Checklist**

### **🏗️ System Architecture**
- [ ] **Appropriate pattern for context** - Architecture pattern fits the problem domain
- [ ] **Separation of concerns** - Different aspects of the system are handled separately
- [ ] **Scalability considerations** - Architecture supports expected growth
- [ ] **Technology independence** - Business logic is independent of specific technologies

### **🔄 Communication Patterns**
- [ ] **Synchronous vs asynchronous** - Appropriate communication pattern for each interaction
- [ ] **Event-driven where beneficial** - Events are used for loose coupling and scalability
- [ ] **Message contracts are stable** - Inter-service communication has well-defined contracts
- [ ] **Failure handling strategies** - System gracefully handles partial failures

---

## 🚀 **Implementation Checklist**

### **💻 Code Organization**
- [ ] **Package structure reflects architecture** - Folder organization follows clean architecture layers
- [ ] **Consistent naming conventions** - Names clearly indicate layer and responsibility
- [ ] **Interface-implementation pairs** - Each abstraction has clear implementations
- [ ] **Configuration externalized** - Configuration is separate from business logic

### **🔍 Code Quality**
- [ ] **SOLID principles followed** - Each class follows Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, etc.
- [ ] **DRY principle applied thoughtfully** - Avoid duplication without creating inappropriate coupling
- [ ] **Error handling is comprehensive** - All failure modes are handled appropriately
- [ ] **Logging and monitoring** - Sufficient observability for production support

---

## 📈 **Performance and Scalability Checklist**

### **⚡ Performance Considerations**
- [ ] **Database query optimization** - Efficient data access patterns
- [ ] **Caching strategy** - Appropriate caching at multiple layers
- [ ] **Lazy loading where appropriate** - Data is loaded only when needed
- [ ] **Async processing for long operations** - Time-consuming operations don't block user interface

### **📐 Scalability Design**
- [ ] **Stateless services** - Services can be scaled horizontally
- [ ] **Database design for scale** - Data model supports expected load
- [ ] **Resource management** - Proper handling of connections, memory, and other resources
- [ ] **Graceful degradation** - System continues to function when components fail

## 🔍 **Review Questions**

Before finalizing any architectural decision, ask:

### **🎯 Business Value**
- Does this design support the business requirements effectively?
- Can the business logic be easily understood and maintained?
- Will this design accommodate likely future changes?

### **🛠️ Technical Excellence**
- Are dependencies pointing in the right direction?
- Is each component focused on a single responsibility?
- Can this design be tested thoroughly and efficiently?

### **👥 Team Effectiveness**
- Can team members easily understand and work with this design?
- Does this design facilitate parallel development?
- Are architectural decisions clearly documented?

## 🎯 **Success Metrics**

Track these indicators of clean architecture success:

### **📊 Quantitative Metrics**
- **Build time** - Faster builds indicate good component separation
- **Test execution time** - Fast tests indicate good dependency management
- **Code coverage** - High coverage indicates testable design
- **Defect density** - Fewer bugs indicate robust architecture

### **👥 Qualitative Metrics**
- **Development velocity** - Teams can add features quickly
- **Onboarding time** - New team members understand the system quickly
- **Deployment confidence** - Teams are confident in their releases
- **Maintenance burden** - Bug fixes and changes are localized and predictable

---

## 💡 **Remember**

**Clean architecture is not about perfection from day one.** It's about:

- **Evolutionary design** - Systems that can adapt and grow
- **Business focus** - Technology serves business needs, not the reverse  
- **Team empowerment** - Developers can work effectively and confidently
- **Long-term thinking** - Decisions that pay off over the life of the system

**Use this checklist as a guide, not a rigid rule set. The goal is systems that serve business needs effectively and can evolve gracefully over time.**
