## 游꿢 Principle 1: Meaningful Names

**Core Concept**: Names should clearly communicate purpose, making code self-documenting.

### Key Guidelines
- **Use Intention-Revealing Names**: `getUserAccountBalance()` not `getData()`
- **Avoid Disinformation**: Don't use misleading abbreviations or similar names
- **Make Meaningful Distinctions**: `source` and `destination` not `a1` and `a2`
- **Use Pronounceable Names**: `generationTimestamp` not `genymdhms`
- **Use Searchable Names**: `MAX_CLASSES_PER_STUDENT` not `7`
- **Avoid Mental Mapping**: `user` not `u`, `index` not `i` (except in very short loops)

### What You'll Learn
- Variable, function, and class naming strategies
- Industry naming conventions and patterns
- How to avoid common naming pitfalls
- Refactoring techniques for improving names

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Using single-letter variables outside of loop counters
- Including type information in names (`userString`, `accountArray`)
- Using jokes or cultural references in professional code
- Inconsistent naming patterns within the same codebase

---

## 游꿢 Principle 2: Functions

**Core Concept**: Functions should be small, do one thing well, and have descriptive names.

### Key Guidelines
- **Small Functions**: Ideally 5-20 lines, rarely over 50
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function should do one thing at one level of abstraction
- **Descriptive Names**: Function names should describe what they do
- **Few Parameters**: Ideal is 0-2 parameters, avoid more than 3
- **No Side Effects**: Functions should not have hidden behaviors
- **Command Query Separation**: Functions should either do something or answer something

### What You'll Learn
- How to break down large functions into smaller ones
- Parameter design and passing strategies
- When and how to use return values vs. exceptions
- Function organization and dependency management

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Functions that try to do multiple things
- Functions with misleading names
- Too many parameters (consider objects instead)
- Functions with side effects not indicated by their names

---

## 游꿢 Principle 3: Comments

**Core Concept**: Good code is self-documenting; comments should explain "why" not "what".

### Key Guidelines
- **Explain Intent**: Why you made certain decisions
- **Clarify Complex Business Rules**: When the domain is inherently complex
- **Warn of Consequences**: Performance implications, threading issues
- **Amplify Importance**: Why something seemingly trivial is actually crucial
- **Legal Comments**: Copyright, licenses when required
- **TODO Comments**: For future improvements (but track and clean up)

### What You'll Learn
- When comments add value vs. create noise
- How to write self-documenting code
- Different types of useful comments
- How to maintain comments as code evolves

### Comments to Avoid
- Redundant comments that repeat the code
- Misleading or outdated comments
- Commented-out code (use version control instead)
- Noise comments (`// increment i`)

---

## 游꿢 Principle 4: Formatting

**Core Concept**: Consistent formatting makes code easier to read and understand.

### Key Guidelines
- **Vertical Formatting**: Related concepts close together, blank lines for separation
- **Horizontal Formatting**: Reasonable line length (80-120 characters)
- **Indentation**: Consistent and meaningful hierarchy
- **Team Consistency**: Everyone follows the same conventions
- **Automated Formatting**: Use tools to maintain consistency

### What You'll Learn
- How formatting affects readability and comprehension
- Vertical and horizontal spacing strategies
- Team formatting standards and enforcement
- Tools for automated code formatting

### Areas of Focus
- Consistent indentation and spacing
- Logical grouping of related code
- Breaking long lines appropriately
- Using whitespace to enhance readability

---

## 游꿢 Principle 5: Objects and Data Structures

**Core Concept**: Objects hide data and expose behavior; data structures expose data and have no behavior.

### Key Guidelines
- **Data Abstraction**: Hide implementation details behind interfaces
- **Object Behavior**: Objects should do things, not just hold data
- **Data Structure Simplicity**: Plain data holders without complex behavior
- **Law of Demeter**: Objects should only talk to immediate friends
- **Tell Don't Ask**: Tell objects what to do rather than asking for their data

### What You'll Learn
- When to use objects vs. data structures
- Proper encapsulation techniques
- Interface design principles
- How to minimize coupling between objects

### Design Patterns
- Adapter pattern for third-party integration
- Factory pattern for object creation
- Strategy pattern for algorithm selection
- Observer pattern for loose coupling

---

## 游꿢 Principle 6: Error Handling

**Core Concept**: Clean error handling separates business logic from error handling concerns.

### Key Guidelines
- **Use Exceptions**: Not return codes for error conditions
- **Write Try-Catch-Finally First**: Structure exception handling early
- **Provide Context**: Error messages should be informative and actionable
- **Define Exception Classes**: Based on caller's needs, not where they're thrown
- **Don't Return Null**: Use special case objects or exceptions instead
- **Don't Pass Null**: Validate parameters at boundaries

### What You'll Learn
- Exception handling strategies and patterns
- How to design meaningful error messages
- Recovery strategies for different types of errors
- Testing error conditions effectively

### Error Handling Patterns
- Special Case pattern for handling nulls
- Circuit Breaker pattern for external services
- Retry with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation strategies

## 游꿢 Principle 7: Boundaries

**Core Concept**: Clean boundaries separate your code from third-party code and external systems.

### Key Guidelines
- **Wrap Third-Party Code**: Don't let it spread throughout your system
- **Define Clear Interfaces**: Abstract away external dependencies
- **Learning Tests**: Write tests to understand third-party behavior
- **Adapter Pattern**: Convert third-party interfaces to your preferred interface
- **Minimize Dependencies**: Only depend on what you actually need

### What You'll Learn
- How to isolate third-party dependencies
- Interface design for external systems
- Testing strategies for integrated systems
- Managing version changes in dependencies

### Boundary Patterns
- Adapter pattern for interface conversion
- Facade pattern for simplifying complex systems
- Repository pattern for data access
- Service layer pattern for business logic

---

## 游꿢 Principle 8: Unit Tests

**Core Concept**: Clean tests are as important as clean production code.

### Key Guidelines
- **Test Structure**: Arrange, Act, Assert pattern
- **One Assert Per Test**: Each test should verify one thing
- **Descriptive Test Names**: Should describe what they're testing
- **Fast Tests**: Tests should run quickly and frequently
- **Independent Tests**: Tests shouldn't depend on each other
- **Repeatable Tests**: Same results in any environment

### What You'll Learn
- Test-driven development (TDD) workflow
- How to structure clean, readable tests
- Mocking and stubbing strategies
- Testing different types of functionality

### Testing Patterns
- Arrange-Act-Assert test structure
- Given-When-Then behavior specification
- Test doubles (mocks, stubs, fakes)
- Property-based testing concepts

---

## 游꿢 Principle 9: Classes

**Core Concept**: Classes should follow SOLID principles and have single, well-defined responsibilities.

### Key Guidelines
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: One reason to change
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Subtypes must be substitutable
- **Interface Segregation**: Many specific interfaces better than one general
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### What You'll Learn
- How to design cohesive classes
- When and how to use inheritance vs. composition
- Interface design and implementation
- Dependency injection patterns

### SOLID Examples
- Extracting interfaces for testability
- Using composition over inheritance
- Designing pluggable architectures

---

## 游꿢 Principle 10: Systems

**Core Concept**: Clean systems separate construction from use and maintain clean boundaries between layers.

### Key Guidelines
- **Separation of Concerns**: Different aspects of the system should be separate
- **Dependency Injection**: Construction should be separate from use
- **Scaling Up**: Start simple, grow the architecture as needed
- **Clean Architecture**: Business logic independent of frameworks
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Handle logging, security, etc. cleanly

### What You'll Learn
- System-level design principles
- How to structure large applications
- Managing cross-cutting concerns
- Clean architecture patterns
